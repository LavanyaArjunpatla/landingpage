                <p class="sc-p">Web designing is the art and process of creating visually appealing and functional
                    websites. It involves the planning, conceptualization, and arrangement of elements on web pages to
                    enhance user experience. Designers use various tools like graphic design software, coding languages,
                    and frameworks to craft layouts, color schemes, and typography that align with a brand's identity.
                    It encompasses responsive design principles, ensuring websites are accessible and optimized across
                    devices. Web designers focus on user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to create intuitive
                    navigation and engaging interactions. They incorporate elements such as images, videos, and
                    animations to convey information effectively, aiming to captivate and retain visitors' attention.

                <p class="sc-p">Video editing is the process of manipulating and rearranging video shots to create a
                    cohesive and compelling narrative or visual story. It involves cutting and sequencing clips,
                    adjusting colors, adding effects, and integrating audio elements to enhance the overall quality.
                    Editors utilize specialized software to refine raw footage into a polished final product, aligning
                    with the intended message or purpose. They craft transitions, overlays, and text to convey
                    information, evoke emotions, and maintain audience engagement. Video editing demands a keen eye for
                    detail, pacing, and storytelling, ensuring seamless continuity and coherence throughout the video.
                    It's a creative endeavor that blends technical skills with artistic expression to produce
                    captivating visual content across various platforms and mediums.</p>

                <h1 class="sc-h1">Photoshop</h1>
                <p class="sc-p">Photoshop is a powerful and versatile software used for editing and manipulating digital
                    images. Developed by Adobe, it offers a wide range of tools and functionalities for photo
                    retouching, compositing, and graphic design. Users can adjust colors, contrast, and brightness,
                    remove imperfections, and apply various filters and effects to enhance or transform images. Layers,
                    masks, and blending modes enable precise editing and non-destructive adjustments, allowing for
                    experimentation and fine-tuning. Photoshop is widely utilized by photographers, designers, and
